= Deploying Machine Learning Models with Red Hat OpenShift Data Science
:navtitle: Home

== Introduction

Generally speaking, an organization decides to train a model, because the organization wishes to empower the applications portfolio with inferences made by such model. In this way, the given known data points of a given event, can produce an inference, guess, or prediction of a topic of interest.

In this course, we will explore how we can leverage Red Hat Data Science tools to answer the question in the following picture:

How do we deliver a model to an inference engine, or server, so that, when the server receives a request from any of the applications in the oragnization's portfolio, the inference engine can reply with a prediction made based in the model that we have previously worked hard to train.
